A visual journey through our most beautiful and delicious custom cakes and treats.
1. Stylesheet & Base Setup
Created an external stylesheet (style.css) and linked it to all HTML pages.
Defined consistent naming conventions for CSS files.
Applied base styles:
Font family → Poppins (body), Playfair Display (headings).
Base font size → 16px.
Colour scheme → Soft pastel pink (#d87b7b), cream (#fff8f0), chocolate brown (#3a2e2e).
Global reset → Used box-sizing: border-box; and reset margins/padding.

2. Typography
Applied consistent heading styles (h1, h2, h3) with hierarchy using rem units.
Improved readability with line-height and letter-spacing.
Styled buttons and links with uppercase text, hover effects, and consistent font weights.

3. Layout Improvements
Implemented Flexbox for navigation bar and footer alignment.
Applied CSS Grid on the menu page to structure products (Artisanal Bread, Cakes, Pastries).
Added spacing and alignment for a clean, balanced layout.

4. Visual Styles
Added background colours and pastel accents to match bakery branding.
Used box-shadow and border-radius for modern card designs on menu items.
Applied hover effects on buttons, links, and product cards for interactivity.

5. Responsive Design
Added media queries for desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints:
Desktop → 3-column grid for menu items.
Tablet → 2-column grid.
Mobile → Single-column layout with stacked navigation.
Used relative units (rem, %) for scalable font sizes and spacing.

6. Images & Accessibility
Added alt attributes to all product images (cakes, bread, pastries).
Used srcset and sizes attributes for responsive image loading.
Ensured images scale (width: 100%; height: auto;) to prevent distortion.

7. Testing & Iteration
Tested design using Chrome, Firefox, and Edge developer tools.
Verified layout across multiple devices and screen sizes.
Adjusted button sizes, text alignment, and spacing for better mobile experience.
Documented screenshots for desktop, tablet, and mobile in the README evidence section.
